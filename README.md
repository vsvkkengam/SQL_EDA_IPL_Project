# SQL_EDA_IPL_Project
➡Steps Performed:
After downloading the data set basic data cleaning is performed using Excel.
then I started creating the database called IPL. In the database, I created multiple tables like matches, players, teams, team wins, players, runs, and deliveries. After creating the tables, I inspected the schemas. Then I imported the CSV files into each table b table data import wizard. I observed the relationship between the tables and then I started querying on the database.

➡ Some of the questions in the project are:
▪ Top 10 players with maximum runs.
▪Top 10 wicket takers.
▪Top 2 players of the match for each season.
▪How many matches were played in the month of April?
▪Finding the season winner for each season.
▪Create a scorecard for each match Id.

▪ CTE
▪ Temporary Tables
▪ Logical Operators
▪ is Null/ not null operators
▪ Date functions
▪ Joins
